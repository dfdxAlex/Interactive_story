                Damn!! In front of me is the muzzle of a large dog, 
                which also seems to be guarding its puppies. 
                There's a metallic object within reach. In the room under the window, 
                there seem to be some crates on which I'm currently standing.

                After landing inside the little house, a dog suddenly appears in front 
                of you. You're standing on crates of unknown strength. 
                There's a metallic object within arm's reach. 
                However, there's no time to figure out what exactly it is. 
                Inside the room, in the distant dark corner, you hear the rustling 
                and whimpering of puppies. 
                It became evident that you ventured here in vain.

                Push off with all your might from the boxes and
                dive back out the window.
                A couple of bruises and bruises are better
                than a hopeless fight with a dog.
