                    Unfamiliar houses and shops. I couldn't have walked this far...<br>
                    What time is it?
                    It's only a quarter past six, and this time of year, the sun may still shine for a while, so...
                    How did I end up here at all?<br>
                    Where am I?
                    And where is everyone?<br>
                    People, certainly. I've been here before - not far from my home.
                    I couldn't recognize the place because it's too empty.<br>
                    Somewhere around here is a pub that I remember from a funny scene: a woman unsuccessfully trying to pull a man away from the bar.
                    An interesting scene, but the question remains: where is everyone?

                  <strong>
                    You were taking a walk, contemplating various things. 
                    For example, global warming, world wars, 
                    even the thought of the Star Trek series briefly crossed your mind. 
                    But the walk was suddenly interrupted. 
                    Something changed, and you didn't immediately understand what was wrong. 
                    But after a few moments, you realized that you were standing on a deserted,
                    wide road all alone. No, you weren't afraid of empty rooms or deserted 
                    streets, but this street wasn't deserted even at night. 
                    It was so unexpected that you concluded you must have ventured far, 
                    into an unfamiliar neighborhood you'd never been to before.
