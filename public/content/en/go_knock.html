                Here it is. <br>Most likely, some kind of fair took place here. 
                A whole row of small wooden stalls was built; 
                one of the shutters clicked. <br>Inside, it was semi-dark, 
                but it was clear that there was no one there. <br>
                The entrance door is not visible, but the window is quite 
                large. <br>Hm. <br>
                Quite large for what? Strange thoughts...

                You approached the cottage whose shutters were clicking. 
                The curtain and the 
                flower on the windowsill indicate that 
                people were here not long ago.

                My home must be somewhere nearby.
